      <div><h1 class="BLOG-H">My First Love</h1></div>
      <div class="BLOG-s"><p>-Anonymous</p></div>

      <div class="BLOG-p"><p>Well this isn't the great experience to share , but I think everyone of us must have been through this problem at some point. And this is about my love life. Well this is something which could either make you or completely destroy you. Well in my case I m still confused ,that it is working which way. Ok let me tell you my story. This happens a month after I got admitted to college . I saw a girl , and got attracted to her. Well this might not be something extraordinary ,but for me it was . And my life totally changed after that . I talked her , and her Every word just made me fall more for her. Finally the time came when , she got to knew about my feelings , and it was a big no from her side. Well the problem started from here only. Couple of sleepless nights, feeling of loneliness, no more hope of living , whole world seemed to end up for me. Afterall it was the first time , and I was not aware of how to deal with this situation . Well this was the problem which everyone seem to make fun , calling me Kabir Singh and all. My friends asked me to forget my my heart refused to each and everyone of them . On one side I had a great respect for her , and found a great friend of mine in her, while on Other side I had dying me, who didn't know what to do. Well the time passed and passed , but I had no improvement in me. My lifestyle was totally disturbed , and condition was getting worse , with the passing time. 

        Well I continued talking to her as a friend but it was , a slow death for me. I also tried to block her couple of times but it was of no help. I knew that something needs to be done, otherwise condition will get worse than ever. Finally I decided to take help from those friends , who have already been through this condition. They understood me quite well , and tried to do everything they could for me. But again , to be honest it was of little help . I used to see her face every night and even during the day time. Some time anonymously texted her. The situation started changing when I started to be with someone all the time . I started passing my hole day , with my friends , cracked joke half heartedly, sometimes even felt like running very very far from all this nuisance ,but somehow I was able to control myself. 
        
        It's been 6 months now ,, and I am fine now, and to be honest , sometimes now also I see her in my dreams , even during daylight , and on somedays the situation is very very bad. But at last I just want to say , that it's alright that you have a heart break , but getting stuck to it ,is the worst thing you can ever do to yourself. And it gets more bad when you have a sense of feel that you can't be with someone ,but still you can't control yourself falling for them. And one more thing I want to say to everyone , that you should not make fun of anyone who is going through this pain, because he is already suffering a lot. He is trying his best to live his normal life but sometimes he just can't get rid of those things. Everyone is not strong enough to move on easily . People with ocean of emotions still exists.,and it's not that they are weak , instead they are strong that they are able to feel the pain , which no one else feels. So we should support him in this though time, nd accept him full heartedly. 
        
        Thank you </p></div>
